This is a brief documentation of the Pier Luca Montessoro's wavlib
functions that make easy reding, creating, modifying and writing
audio files (WAV format, 44.1 KHz, 16 bits/sample).
See also the example programs.


DATA TYPES
----------
- short int    represent a sample (one channel)
- WAVE         the wave file stored in memory


MACRO
-----
- SAMPLE(wave, channel, offset)  returns a short int representing the 
                                 sample in position offset


FUNCTIONS
---------
- WAVE  ReadWave (FILE *fp);
  reads a wave file and returns the data structure representing it in memory

- void  WriteWave (WAVE wave, FILE *fp);
  writes a wave file

- WAVE  CreateEmptyCDaudioWave (unsigned long int numofstereosamples);
  creates an empty wave structure in memory

- void  ReleaseWaveData (WAVE *wave);
  releases the memory allocated by CreateEmptyCDaudioWave


HOW TO COMPILE
--------------
- gcc -o <name>.exe -DBMPSHOWALL <name>.c wav.c
  (both source file and library files - wav.c and wav.h - must be 
  in current directory)

- using the script file cc_wav.bat (DOS/Windows): cc_wav <name>

- using the script file cc_wav.sh (Unix): ./cc_wav.sh <name>
